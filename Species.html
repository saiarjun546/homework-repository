        <h1>Protection of Endangered Species.</h1>
        <h2>What are Endangered Species.</h2>
        <p>
            Endangered Species: An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either
            worldwide or in a
            particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching and
            invasive species.<br>
            Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land
            development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as
            captive breeding and habitat restoration.
            </p>
        <h2>How do we Conserve Endangered Species.</h2>
        <p>
            Endangered Species Can be conserved in many ways. Here are 2 of the most popular methods of Conservation of
            Endangered Species.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Method 1: Capatative Farming</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with
            restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, and other conservation facilities.
            Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilise the population of the species that it
            will not disappear.
            <br>
            <br>
            This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive
            mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the PÃ¨re David's deer. However,
            captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory
            birds
            (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. hilsa). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then
            inbreeding
            may occur due to a reduced gene pool and reduce resistance.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Method 2: Private Farming</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the
            opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern black rhinoceros and southern white
            rhinoceros.
            <br>
            <br>
            Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature), said of such
            programs, "Effective law enforcement has become much
            easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into
            conservation programs. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather
            than
            simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The
            private
            sector has been key to helping our work."
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2009, researchers in Australia managed to coax southern bluefin tuna to breed in landlocked tanks, raising the
            possibility that fish farming may be able to save the species from overfishing.
