            <b>Deforestation: </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Deforestation, clearance, clearcutting or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees from land which is then
            converted to a non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land to farms, ranches, or urban use.
            The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. About 31% of Earth's land surface is covered by
            forests.
            <br>
            <br>
            The primary cause of deforestation is agriculture. Trees are cut down for use as building material or sold as fuel
            (sometimes in the form of charcoal or timber), while cleared land is used as pasture for livestock and plantation. The
            vast majority of agricultural activity resulting in deforestation is subsidized by government tax revenue. Disregard
            of ascribed value, lax forest management, and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that lead to
            large-scale deforestation. Deforestation in many countries—both naturally occurring and human-induced—is an ongoing
            issue. Between 2000 and 2012, 2.3 million square kilometres (890,000 sq mi) of forests around the world were cut
            down.

            The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity.
            Deforestation causes extinction, changes to climatic conditions, desertification, and displacement of populations, as
            observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record. Deforestation also has adverse impacts on
            biosequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to global warming.
            Global warming also puts increased pressure on communities who seek food security by clearing forests for agricultural
            use and reducing arable land more generally. Deforested regions typically incur significant other environmental effects
            such as adverse soil erosion and degradation into wasteland. According to a study published in Nature Scientific Reports
            if deforestation continue in current rate in the next 20 - 40 years, it can trigger a full or almost full extinction of
            humanity. To avoid it humanity should pass from a civilization dominated by the economy to "cultural society" that
            "privileges the interest of the ecosystem above the individual interest of its components, but eventually in accordance
            with the overall communal interest"

            <h2>What effect does Deforestation have on our Environment?</h2>
            <p>
                Deforestation is ongoing and is shaping climate and geography.
                <br>
                <br>
                Deforestation is a contributor to global warming, and is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Tropical deforestation is responsible
                for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions.

                Plants remove carbon in the form of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis, but release
                some carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere during normal respiration. Only when actively growing can a tree or forest
                remove carbon, by storing it in plant tissues. Both the decay and the burning of wood release much of this stored carbon
                back into the atmosphere. Although an accumulation of wood is generally necessary for carbon sequestration, in some
                forests the network of symbiotic fungi that surround the trees' roots can store a significant amount of carbon, storing
                it underground even if the tree which supplied it dies and decays, or is harvested and burned.

                Rainforests are widely believed by laymen to contribute a significant amount of the world's oxygen, although it is now accepted by scientists that rainforests contribute little net oxygen to the atmosphere and
                deforestation has only a minor effect on atmospheric oxygen levels. However, the incineration and burning of forest plants to clear land releases large amounts of CO2, which contributes to
                global warming.
